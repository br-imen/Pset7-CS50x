        --RAYMOND- As the thief was leaving the bakery,
        --they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
        --In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
        --The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket.

        --RUTH-| Sometime within ten minutes of the theft,
        --I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery parking lot and drive away.
        -- If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot,
        --you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.

        --EUGINE--| I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
        -- Earlier this morning, before I arrive
        -- at Emma's bakery,
        --I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.
